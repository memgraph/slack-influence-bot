Are you curious about the affinity of the people in your organization? Do you
ever wonder what kind of conversation draws the most attention in your community
or the most frequently used emojis? **Slack Influencer** allows you to
introspect your Slack community providing you with valuable insights and
analytics of its members.

At its core, Slack Influencer uses **Memgraph** to leverage the power of
knowledge graphs while scraping slack messages in real-time. The data produced
is then stored in Memgraph and consumed by your soon-to-be favorite Slack bot
plugin. The bot acts as an interactive tool in that the user queries for
analytics.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

* [Docker >= 20.0.0](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [Slack bot
  app](https://slack.com/intl/en-hr/help/articles/115005265703-Create-a-bot-for-your-workspace)

## üñ•Ô∏è Quick start

### Setup Slack bot application

Make sure to set up a Slack bot application where you will need two tokens for
the application to work

* Application token: `xapp-...` _(step 2 below)_
* Bot token: `xoxb-...` _(step 5 below)_

Follow the steps below to create the bot, set up scopes, and get the tokens:

1. Create a Slack app if you don't already have one, or select an existing app
   you've created.
2. Under **Basic Information > App-Level Tokens** create a new **App Token**
   with a scope `connections:write`.
3. Under **Socket Mode** make sure to enable the socket mode.
4. Under **Slash Commands** create the following commands:
    * Name: `/influence`
    * Short description: `Influence the community`
    * Usage hint: `[help | me | channel | message]`
    * Escape channels, users, and links sent to your app: `Checked!`
5. Under **OAuth & Permissions* generate a **Bot User OAuth Token** and add the
   following scopes to "Bot Token Scopes":
    * `app_mentions:read`
    * `channels:history`, `channels:read`
    * `groups:history`, `groups:read`
    * `users:read`, `users.profile:read`
    * `chat:write`
    * `commands`
    * `reactions:read`
6. Under **Event Subscriptions** make sure to enable Events and to select the
   following events for "Subscribe to bot events":
   * `message.channels`
   * `message.groups`
   * `reaction_added`
   * `reaction_removed`
   * `member_joined_channel`
7. Add the bot to all the public channels that you want to handle with the
   project
8. Once you have two tokens, feel free to save them locally in the `.env` file
   in the following format:

```
export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...
export SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-...
```

### Start the platform

#### Environment

Before starting a platform that consists of the Slack bot application, Kafka,
Zookeeper, and Memgraph, make sure to have environment variables
`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` defined.

You can check if the environment variables are set by calling the following
command:

```bash
docker-compose config
```

In the output, you should see the values of your tokens in the following two
lines:

```
...
      - SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...
      - SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-...
...
```

#### Build and run

Run the platform with the following command:

```
docker-compose up
```

#### Tools

#### Connect to Memgraph

Download [Memgraph Lab](https://memgraph.com/download) and connect to running
Memgraph:

```
Username: <Empty>
Password: <Empty>
Endpoint: localhost 7687
Encrypted: Off
``` 

#### Connect to Kafka

If you wish the check the state of Kafka and the topic where slack events have
been produced to, run the following command:

```
docker run -it -p 9000:9000 -e KAFKA_BROKERCONNECT=localhost:9092 obsidiandynamics/kafdrop
```

> Note: If you are running Docker on Mac or Windows, the value of
> `KAFKA_BROKERCONNECT` should be `host.docker.internal:9093`.

Open up the internet browser and to the address
[localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000).


### Load the historical data

When you start the platform, you will start to receive events from that point
on. If you wish to include messages and reactions from public/private channels
where the bot is a member, you can use the utility functions to load up the last
N messages (including reactions and thread replies) from channels:

```
# Get 100 messages (with threads and reactions) from public/private channels where
# bot is member of and forward it to the local file `events.json`
python3 slack_history.py events -n=100 > events.json

# For every slack historical event, forward it to the Kafka so Memgraph can fetch it
# and update the graph model
cat events.json | python3 utils/kafka_json_producer.py slack-events
```

## ‚ùî Find out more about Memgraph

Memgraph makes creating real-time streaming graph applications accessible to
every developer. Spin up an instance, consume data directly from Kafka, and
build on top of everything from super-fast graph queries to PageRank and
Community Detection.
